# pascals-patterns

- Visualisation of modulus operation on pascals triangle with a [live demo](http://mythking.uk.ms) on my website
- When using mod2 you are able to estimate Sierpinski's Triangle until approximately row 32.
- All values display their final digit however calculations are applied to the full value.

Default Config - calculating mod2 to 32 rows with rgb(0,255,255) and rgb(255,255,0) as color values
